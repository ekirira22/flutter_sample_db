# sample_flutter_app

This is a simple flutter app that collects data from the app and inserts this data in a database
For this to work you must have a remote server installed, preferrably xampp or wamp server.
Inside the folder c-xampp-htdocs is a file containig the file submit_data.php which is supposed to be located
in the htdocs folder under xampp or wamp(whichever you decide to use).
Apache needs to be learning and '10.0.2.2' should be used as the localhost since 'localhost' or 127.0.0.1 
won't work for android projects.
